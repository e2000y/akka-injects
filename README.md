Akka Injects
==========================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jw3/akka-injects.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jw3/akka-injects)
[![Dependencies](https://app.updateimpact.com/badge/701268856357916672/akka-injects.svg?config=compile)](https://app.updateimpact.com/latest/701268856357916672/akka-injects)

Dependency Injection DSL for Akka.
Powered by [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) and implemented as an [Akka Extension](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/scala/extending-akka.html).

#### Goals

- Inject to ```val```
- Easy optional injects
- Do not require Annotations
- Respect Actor parent context
- Avoid handling Injectors
- Act like Guice
- Concise DSL

#### Installation

By default the Inject Extension will be loaded on first use.

Or

If you want to force load the extension at ```ActorSystem``` creation time you can [Load from Configuration](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/scala/extending-akka.html#Loading_from_Configuration).

```HOCON
akka {
  extensions = ["com.rxthings.di.InjectExt"]
}
```

#### Artifacts

To include in your SBT project add a resolver to your sbt build

```resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("jw3", "maven")```

and add the dependency

```libraryDependencies += "com.rxthings" %% "akka-injects" % "0.9"```

#### Imports

All required imports are included with

```import com.rxthings.di._```

#### Configuration Options

- ```akka.inject.mode```: specifies the module discovery strategy ```[manual | config | spi]```
- ```akka.inject.modules```: specifies the FQCN list of Modules when in ```config``` mode
- ```akka.inject.cfg```: specify whether to provide the application Config through the Injector

#### Module Discovery Modes

The default mode is ```manual```

- ```manual```: Manual discovery mode that only uses Modules added through ```InjectExtBuilder```
- ```config```: Configuration discovery mode that uses modules specified in the ```CfgModuleDiscoveryKey```
- ```spi```: SPI discovery mode uses modules provided by the [Java Service Provider Interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html) (SPI)

#### Example Usage

Injection is implicit when the lhs is explicitly typed
```scala
val config: Config = inject[Config]

val thing: Thing = inject[Thing]

val named: String = inject[String] annotated "namedString"

val actor: ActorRef = injectActor[MyActor]

```

Optional injection is also implicit when the lhs is an ```Option```
```scala
val optionalThing: Option[Thing] = inject[Thing]

val optionalActor: Option[ActorRef] = injectActor[MyActor]

val noThing: Option[Unbound] = inject[Unbound] // == None

val noActor: Option[ActorRef] = injectActor[UnboundActor] // == None
```

When lhs is not explicitly typed, the ```required``` or ```optional``` method must be called
```scala
val thing = inject[Thing] required

val actor = injectActor[MyActor] required

val optionalThing = inject[Thing] optional

val optionalActor = injectActor[MyActor] optional
```

Parameters can be passed to ctors using ```arguments```
```scala
val thingWithCtorArgs: Thing = inject[Thing] arguments("foo", 999)
```

Shortcuts for binding annotations, like ```@Named```
```scala
val bob: Option[ActorRef] = injectActor[MyActor] named "bob"
```

Injection within an Actor is easy and final
```scala
class MyActor extends Actor {
    val otherActor: ActorRef = inject[MyOtherActor] // otherActor.parent == self
    val configProp: String = inject[String] named "myactor.hostname"
}
```

#### Notes

- [SPI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html) is provided by registering ```com.google.inject.Module``` implementations as services within `META-INF.services`
- Use ```lazy``` to break cycles
- The application config is available by default through the ```Config``` binding
- [ScalaGuice](https://github.com/codingwell/scala-guice) uses ```Manifest``` so we do too
